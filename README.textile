h1. Hello!

This is my blog. It uses  "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll to transform it into a static site that gets pushed to GitHub. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

h1. Installing on Ubuntu

  sudo apt-get install ruby rubygems
  sudo gem install rubygems-update
  sudo gem install jekyll
  sudo easy_install pygments

h1. Running

To build the website:

  rake

To run the built-in server:

  rake server
