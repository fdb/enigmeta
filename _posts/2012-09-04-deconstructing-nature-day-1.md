title: Deconstructing Nature - Day 1
---
My colleague Werner and I are holding a challenge this week to produce **one work each day**. I've given myself the theme of "Deconstructing Nature", which you can interpret as wide as you want.

Here's the result from day 1:

Here are some details of the work:

The work is made in [NodeBox 1](http://nodebox.net/) using a tweaked [Boids algorithm](http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Boids) (created by Tom De Smedt).

Here is a timelapse video of the creation:

Here are some other sketches I made:
