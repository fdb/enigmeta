title: Making of my PhD Thesis Generator

On June 15, I promoted as PhD in the Arts from the University of Antwerp / ARIA. My research was about the impact of generative design tools. I researched how generative design tools affect the quality and creativity of designers using the tools, and whether they were more efficient and self-reliant.

A PhD in the arts lies somewhere between scientific research and artistic practice. It is at times both, and at other times neither. It requires you to create art as well as perform research.

This battle between two sides is represented in the thesis as well. In the spirit of the research I didn't simply want to create a thesis, but a thesis *generator*: a system that could generate endless variations of the thesis (keeping the content intact but playing with the design).

I've opted to created **"the slider"**: an interactive element that allows you to choose for yourself whether you want an artistic or scientific thesis. The design is adapted to match, and every design will be unique.

Some designs evolve over multiple pages, gradually changing background elements from page to page. Flipping through the thesis results in interesting animations:

I had a selection of these thesises printed. Each design used different font sizes and margins, meaning layouts had to be recalculated, talking typical typesetting issues like [widows and orphans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans) into account. The total number of pages varied between 140 and 180, meaning that the thickness of the book varied as well. I added routines to calculate the width of the spine and generate different-sized book covers based on those calculations.

The thesis generator was built in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>. It doesn't use any additional packages apart from the Go standard library. All bytes of the PDF are generated by my own software.
