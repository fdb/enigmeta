While learning [Overtone](http://overtone.github.io/) I've created a composition that randomly downloads sounds from [freesounds.org](http://www.freesound.org/) and makes beat-like soundscapes with them. (First composition starts at 1"20.)

If you want to try this yourself, start by downloading Leiningen from [leiningen.org](http://leiningen.org/).
