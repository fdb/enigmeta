The 2012 American elections promise to be exciting. Candidates throwing mud at eachother, and attacks becoming increasingly more personal. But how different are the candidates really?

As part of the [Generator.x 3.0 workshop](http://www.imal.org/en/activity/generatorx3) by [Marius Watz](http://mariuswatz.com/), I worked together with Lieven Menschaert to produce three-dimensional lasercut heads detailing what really goes through the minds of the republican and democratic candidates.

Using generative software, we map the democratic and republican candidate on a variety of layers:

* Keywords layers: containing keywords from quotes of political candidates on important issues.
* Campaign contributions: amount of contributions from various sectors.
* Regional popularity: a map of the states linked to a certain party.

The project uses an alpha version of [NodeBox 3](http://alpha.nodebox.net/), developed simultaneously with the project.
