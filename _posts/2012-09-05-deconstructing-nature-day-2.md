*My colleague Werner and I are holding a challenge this week to produce one visual work each day. I'm working around the theme of "Deconstructing Nature".*

[Day 1](/2012/09/04/deconstructing-nature-day-1) | [Day 2](/2012/09/05/deconstructing-nature-day-2) | [Day 3](/2012/09/06/deconstructing-nature-day-3) | [Day 4](/2012/09/07/deconstructing-nature-day-4) | [Day 5](/2012/09/08/deconstructing-nature-day-5)

For the second day I wanted to do something *physical*. I was thinking about the act of deconstructing â€“ breaking something down to its simplest components. "Simpling".

This brought me to the idea of microscopy. I discovered that you can do extreme macro-photography by installing the lens *backwards* on a camera.

I did some experiments with my aging DSLR, but results were not as sharp as I hoped. However, I discovered that I can "attach" a regular lens to my smartphone, producing very detailed images. I used this technique to create the final image.

Here's the result from day 2:
