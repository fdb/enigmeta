Font creation technologies have so far largely been written in C or Python and offered to users as desktop applications or command line tools. Since 2014, the library OpenType.js has been able to **parse and generate fonts in JavaScript**. This opens up exciting possibilities for detailed control over all of aspects of typography on the web.

By parsing the binary font format, OpenType.js provides direct access to the **letter shapes** of each of the glyphs in the font.

Once we have access to the shapes, it's easy to experiment and generate new letter forms.
