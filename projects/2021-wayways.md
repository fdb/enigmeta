**WayWays is a mobile app that brings interactive theatre experiences to public spaces. Using QR codes and a chat-based interface, audiences explore urban areas while interacting with virtual characters through text, photos, and videos.**

The project was commissioned by [Open Doek](https://opendoek.be/), a non-profit championing amateur theatre in Flanders, Belgium. After the success of their QR-coded audio stories on public benches during the COVID-19 pandemic, Open Doek wanted to expand the concept into more interactive experiences.

I developed the mobile app using React Native, which allowed deployment to both iOS and Android platforms. The app integrates with [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/), a story editor that enables writers to create branching, interactive narratives without technical complexity.

The first story created for WayWays was "The Society of Odd Birds" by theatre maker [Jo Jochems](https://www.jojochems.be/), aimed at audiences aged 8 and above. Players start their adventure by scanning a QR code, then navigate through a series of puzzles and tasks while chatting with virtual characters. The experience combines digital interaction with physical props scattered across designated urban areas.

The app was launched on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, with experiences rolled out in approximately eight cities across Flanders, Belgium.
