**NodeBox Live is a web application for data visualization and generative design. It integrates seamlessly with the web, transforming data from multiple services into interactive visualizations.**

It is designed to be <strong>efficient</strong> and <strong>interactive</strong>: changes to the network are immediately visible, and parameters can be controlled by dragging handles directly in the viewer. The software can import data from many sources, manage the data, transform it into visual objects and animate them. All this can be integrated into the web.

The application was designed to help _non-programmers_ visualize data using a powerful visual metaphor. The application is in active use and has been used for data visualization workshops with students and design professionals.

Through an intuitive interface, variations can easily be created. This typographic example shows all variations just by dragging around parameters.

The application can be used for **data visualization** and **generative design**. We regularly undertake user studies to optimize usability.

Integration with <a href="/projects/opentype-js/">OpenType.js</a> opens up the world of generative typography on the web.

The programming model supports both **visual programming** and **textual programming**.

By integrating with **web services**, the visualizations can be linked to _live data_. This example shows a generative typeface that **changes according to current wind speed and direction**.
