title: Deconstructing Nature - Day 4

*My colleague Werner and I are holding a challenge this week to produce one visual work each day. I'm working around the theme of "Deconstructing Nature".*

[Day 1](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day1) — [Day 2](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day2) — [Day 3](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day3) — [Day 4](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day4) — [Day 5](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day5)

I focused on using the [Superformula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superformula), a formula that can be used to describe many complex shapes and curves found in nature.

The supershape uses a "base shape" of a circle by default, but the [NodeBox library](http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Supershape) also supports using an arbitrary shape as the base.

So what if we constructed supershapes on top of supershapes? Repeatedly? That's what I did today:
