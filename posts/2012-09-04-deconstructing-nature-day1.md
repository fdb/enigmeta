title: Deconstructing Nature - Day 1

My colleague Werner and I are holding a challenge this week to produce **one visual work each day**. I've given myself the theme of **"Deconstructing Nature"**, which you can interpret as wide as you want.

[Day 1](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day1) — [Day 2](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day2) — [Day 3](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day3) — [Day 4](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day4) — [Day 5](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day5)

For the first day I wanted to design the layout of a space – specifically a _garden_ – according to patterns occurring in nature. I thought about:

- The spread of forest fires
- The intricate nerve pattern of plants
- Patterns of underground movement: worms, ants, tree roots, ...

I liked the idea of constructing something above ground that followed movement patterns below ground. I stumbled a lot trying to model the movement of worms, but in the end used a tweaked boids algorithm to produce strange natural/artifical hybrids.

Here's the result from day 1:

Here are some details of the work:

The work is made in [NodeBox 1](http://nodebox.net/) using a tweaked [Boids algorithm](http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Boids) (created by Tom De Smedt).

Here are some other sketches I made:
