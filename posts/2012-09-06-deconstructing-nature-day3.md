title: Deconstructing Nature - Day 3

---

_My colleague Werner and I are holding a challenge this week to produce one visual work each day. I'm working around the theme of "Deconstructing Nature"._

[Day 1](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day1) — [Day 2](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day2) — [Day 3](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day3) — [Day 4](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day4) — [Day 5](/blog/deconstructing-nature-day5)

Inspired by Werner's work I wanted to do something with swarms. For another project we're talking about creating a _living wallpaper_ which I also wanted to integrate here. And I wanted to make something that was animated and a little bit interactive.

I decided to create an animated swarm in a browser, using trails to create a wallpaper. I used the excellent [three.js](http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/) library to access WebGL.

Here's the result from day 3. **Click the image to view it live (Chrome / Firefox)**.

**Keys**:

- _Hold Spacebar_: Direct the swarm to the center.
- _C_: Clear the screen.
