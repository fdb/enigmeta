<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>If, and why, procedural tools are "better" for graphic designers than traditional tools, such as Photoshop or Illustrator.</p>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Better?</h1>
<ul>
    <li>More productive</li>
    <li>Broader approach</li>
    <li>New esthetics</li>
    <li>Self-reliant</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>More efficient: are users faster in getting results than with traditional applications?</p>
<p>Broader approach: are users able to test more approaches before settling on a final design?</p>
<p>New esthetics: are users to create new designs that push the state of the art?</p>
<p>Self-reliant: are users able to help themselves if they get stuck?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Traditional vs Procedural Tools</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Traditional: Photoshop, Illustrator</li>
    <li>Procedural: NodeBox, Processing, vvvv</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
<p>To compare the two approaches to design, it is important to delimit the boundary between traditional applications and procedural applications. For the purpose of my research, I look at the representation -- the mental model -- for the software. Traditional applications provide a 1-to-1 mapping between the visual representation and the model. This approach is called WYSIWYG -- What You See Is What You Get. Procedural applications diverge from this model in a number of ways. Some represent the design as steps in code, some provide a node-based environment, some use context-free rule models. What is important is that each of these applications shun the traditional approach of drag and drop. Their model in some way goes beyond the immediate visual representation on screen and works on an underlying model that can be manipulated.</p>

<h1>Research in the arts</h1>
<p>Research <strong>in</strong> the arts, not <strong>about</strong> the arts.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>The reason had some remarks the first time was that it was about research about the arts, not research in the arts. </p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Artistic research</h1>
<p>Social commitment & art.</p>
<div class="handout">
<p>My artistic research wants to map social commitment using a generative approach.</p>
<p>I chose this theme from personal interest, and from our roots in the free software community.</p>
<p>Social commitment in arts exists for a long time already. A work of art can object to a social phenomenon without giving the work a participative character. Other artists anchor their work in the neighborhood or community with which they have a strong bond.</p>
<p>In my research social commitment means a search for participation. A way to let the public participate, start a conversation, allow co-creation.</p>
<p>There are three projects.</p>
</div>
</div>



<div class="slide">
<h1>Artistic research</h1>
<h2>1. Collaboration</h2>
<img src="img/mud-tub.png" alt="Mud Tub">
<div class="handout">
<p>The first project investigates the role of the participant. It examines the ways visitors can participate in a project and how far reaching that participation can be. The end result is not fixed yet but the research will lead to hardware interfaces such as game controllers and EEG "brain" helmets. It also looks at long-term participation: how do we engage visitors long before and after experiencing the work?? Can the project be the catalyst for enduring commitment?</p>
<p>Example by Tom Gerhardt. Experimental organic interface that allows people to control a computer while playing in the mud.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Artistic research</h1>
<h2>2. Visualization</h2>
<img src="img/streamgraph.png" alt="Streamgraph">
<div class="handout">
<p>The second project maps social commitment. It examines examples of existing social commitment, showing the social dynamics between people. We draw data from available databases and visualize correlations between data sets.</p>
<p>An example of existing work is the Stream Graph Lee Byron</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Artistic research</h1>
<h2>3. Crowdsourcing</h2>
<img src="img/ten-thousand-cents.png"  alt="Ten Thousand Cents">
<div class="handout">
<p>Crowdsourcing is a technique whereby problems not easily solved by computers are outsourced to groups of (usually anonymous) work forces. These people categorize images, determine the meaning of a piece of text, assess the quality of a video clip etc.. The function of crowdsourcing as a business tool and especially as an artistic medium, is still largely undetermined. This project uses the medium in a search for participation and co-creation.</p>
<p>An example of existing work is "Ten Thousand Cents" by Aaron Koblin</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Masterclasses and workshops</h1>
<img src="img/workshop-mac.jpg" alt="Workshop Mac">
<div class="handout">
<p>We test usability by holding masterclasses and workshops.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>External users</h1>
<img src="img/usability-pilot-screencap.png" height="75%" alt="Usability Pilot Screencap">
<div class="handout">
<p>NodeBox has amassed a number of users through the years, ranging from professionals using the tools for commercial work to amateurs who do exploratory work. We use their work and insights to research how NodeBox leads to new esthetics and better productivity.</p>
<p>Here, you see a pilot study with a new NodeBox users, as he tries to make an example assignment.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Research Domains</h1>
<h2>Graphs</h2>
<div class="handout">
<p>Node-based applications such as NodeBox 2, vvvv, Quartz Composer et al express a set of operations as a graph. The graph representation is an important aspect that defines the expressiveness of the system. This representation is important.</p>
<p>We have a meeting about this in the future.</p>
<p>One thing we discovered recently is that acyclic is not the best way to go.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Research Domains</h1>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<div class="handout">
<p>For graphic designers to be productive, it is important that they can be happy while working with the application. When you're good, you gain a flow that means you're in sync with the tools you're using. Attaining this flow is a question of software ergonomics.</p>
<p>One of the most important metrics in software is "happiness". This is hard to measure, but it should be possible to measure indicators that identify frustration, efficiency and "flow". This is really important in applications. It defines in what sense users are able to express themselves without constantly being stopped by the application.</p>
