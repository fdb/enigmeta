title: Wandering Ants
layout: page
---
This is a simple algorithm for crawling and reproducing ants, initially designed for a [NodeBox](https://www.nodebox.net/) workshop. Each time two ants meet, they produce offspring. However, nobody dies, so the population grows explosively.

The film will be featured at the <a href="http://www.wolverhamptonart.org.uk/visit/wolves/">Wolverhampton Art Gallery</a>.
