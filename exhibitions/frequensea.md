**What if we could see all the electromagnetic radiation that's around us? That's the question the Frequensea project asks. Through custom software, the exhibition shows the electromagnetic spectrum in print and realtime and in virtual reality.**

Frequensea consists of a 10m print on aluminium of the frequency spectrum, a number of projections and a virtual reality installation where you can see the spectrum in real time. The exhibition was organized in SHOWROOM, Antwerp in March 2015, in collaboration with Lucas Nijs, Pieter Heremans and Lieven Menschaert of <a href="https://www.emrg.be/">EMRG</a>.

The Wi-Fi part of the spectrum is especially busy:

Special tracking software installed on a Raspberry Pi allowed us to track airplanes, live.
