Word Maze explores the theme of concealment and discovery. It consists of three movies each containing a word that is initially invisible and becoming more and more clear, although never at once. The words are generated using a pixelated font generator that is combined with a modified recursive backtracking algorithm to produce a maze that is gradually built up and torn down. The project is made in <a href="https://www.nodebox.net/code/">NodeBox 1</a>.

Word Maze was exhibited at the "Traveling Letters" exhibition in 2011 in Vilnius, Lithuania.
