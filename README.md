This is my personal blog. It is written using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.app/).

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install`. Then, to start the development server:

```
npm start
```

## Building

When pushing to the `main` branch, the site will be deployed automatically to Netlify. To create a local production version of the site:

```
npm run build
```
