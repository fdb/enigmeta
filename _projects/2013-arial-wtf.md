The TrueType file format is a rigid, arcane and brittle font standard that stores the letter shapes of your type faces. One single wrong bit turns the letter shapes into weird and wonderful figures.

This work represents the struggle interpreting the Arial typeface and shows the happy accidents that occur when things go wrong. Just like jazz music, it's impromptu and unrehearsed which makes it interesting.

*Arial.wtf was  part of the "Traveling Letters â€” Typo Jazz" exhibition organized in Vilnius, Lithuania in 2013.*

**Print on paper, 70cm x 100cm. Technique: JavaScript, OpenType.**
