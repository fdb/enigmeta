Traveling Letters takes the theme of the exhibition quite literally. What if letters had to travel to form words? What if only a single letter of the alphabet was available, having to travel from one word to the next? Would the text still be readable? Would the letters grow weary? Would their trails form patterns?

We designed a custom typeface and application that demonstrates this concept. To display the text, letters travel from their position on the shelf to the needed positions in the word. As they move they leave colored trails, showing intricate patterns of letter movement throughout the text. Unneeded letters are placed back on the shelf. Frequently used letters grow weary and start distorting.

The Traveling Letters installation was part of the "Traveling Letters" exhibition organized in Lahti, Finland in 2012.
